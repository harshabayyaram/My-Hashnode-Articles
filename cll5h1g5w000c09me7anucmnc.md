***Greetings***, readers! Today, we are gonna deep dive into the most interesting board Arduino.

## What is an Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It was designed for engineers, designers, and others who want to incorporate physical computing into their designs without having any prerequisite engineering knowledge and with less investement.

Arduino consists of a physical programmable board (referred to as a microcontroller) and an Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your laptops and computers, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

## Detailed information about the board

## Various types of Arduino

Various types of Arduino boards available in the market contain different compatibilities and functions.

* Here under is the compilation of some of the most suited Arduino Boards for beginners! They are:
    

#### 1\. ARDUINO UNO REV3

* The Arduino Uno is the ideal board for beginners as it is your entry to the unique Arduino experience: great for learning the basics of how sensors and actuators work.
    
* Arduino Uno Rev3 is the most used and documented board in the Arduino family. Many tutorials and projects are available online with instructions for you to get started.
    
* It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which six can be used as PWM outputs), six analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, and an ICSP header, and a reset button.
    
* It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
    

#### 2\. ARDUINO LEONARDO

* The Leonardo Arduino board is a Microcontroller board, and it is based on the [**ATmega32u4 data sheet**](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/241078/ATMEL/ATMEGA32U4.html). This Arduino board has 20 digital input pins, a 16MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a RESET pin, and a power jack.
    
* It has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. This allows the Leonardo to appear on a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial COM port.
    

#### 3\. ARDUINO RED BOARD

* The Arduino red board is programmed by using the USB cable of mini-B with the help of Arduino IDE software.
    
* Without any modifications in the security system, it works in all operating systems (OS). The Arduino red board is more consistent because USB and FTDI chips are used, and they are flat on the back.
    
* It is effortless to create during project design. Just plug the board, select the menu option to choose an Arduino UNO, and you are ready to upload the program. You can control the RedBoard over a USB cable using the barrel jack.
    

#### 4\. LILYPAD ARDUINO

![LILYPAD ARDUINO](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656226157185/sebDu3mwH.webp?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="center")

* LilyPad is a wearable e-textile technology developed by Leah Buechley and cooperatively designed by Leah and SparkFun.
    
* Each LilyPad was creatively designed with large connecting pads and a flat back to allow them to be sewn into clothing with conductive thread.
    
* The LilyPad has its own family of input, output, power, and sensor boards explicitly built for e-textiles. They're even washable!

## **ARDUINO CODING ENVIRONMENT AND BASIC TOOLS**

After understanding the hardware of the Arduino Boards, let us now get started with Arduino programming.

Arduino code is written in C++ with an addition of special methods and functions. C++ is a human-readable programming language.

#### ARDUINO IDE

The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the main text editing program used for Arduino programming. It is where the main programmable code is written before uploading it to the board you want to program. Arduino code is referred to as **SKETCHES**.

Arduino IDE can be downloaded from [**here**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

#### CODE STRUCTURE

```typescript
  void setup(){
     //       put your setup code here to run once:
  }

  void loop(){

     //       put your loop code here to run repeatedly:
  }
```

* **LIBRARIES:** Arduino has various built-in libraries which perform multiple functionalities. In addition, it is possible to import other libraries and expand the Arduino board's capabilities and features.
    
* **BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS :**
    
* **Setup()** Every Arduino sketch must have a setup function. This function defines the initial state of the Arduino upon boot and runs only once.
    
    Here we'll define the following:
    
    1. Pin functionality using the pinMode function
        
    2. The initial state of the pins
        
    3. Initialize classes
        
    4. Initialize variables
        
    5. Code logic
        
    
    Setup() is also called Preparation Block.
    
    * **loop()**
        
        The loop function is also necessary for every Arduino sketch and executes once setup() is complete. It is the primary function; as its name hints, it runs in a loop repeatedly. The loop describes the main logic of your circuit.
        
        Loop() is also called Execution block.
