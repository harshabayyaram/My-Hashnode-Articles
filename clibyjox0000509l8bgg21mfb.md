### What is this article about?

Greetings, readers! Today, I am thrilled to introduce myself on a new chapter of my life, one that combines my passion for engineering with my <mark>newfound love</mark> for the written word. As an *engineer to an article writer*, I invite you to join me on this exciting adventure where <mark>technical expertise converges with creative expression</mark>, as I explore the art of article writing through the lens of my engineering background. üöÄüìù

Though I used to write a blog early in the 2020s using Google Blogger (Fun fact: It was deleted in 2021) and a tech youtube channel (Literally I do have some videos recorded in the 2020s). But due to a lack of encouragement and support, I lost it. But somehow a book *<mark>"Show your work"</mark>* <mark>book by Austin Kleon</mark> helped me out figure out my passion and share my thoughts socially.

### About me

Ok ok, getting into the matter I am *Harsha, a BTech student from India*, who is trying to beat procrastination and introduce myself socially to the world through article writing about my journey as an engineer and to introduce new technologies.

For years, my career as an engineer has allowed me to jump into the fascinating world of problem-solving, innovation, and cutting-edge technologies.

*With each problem, I witnessed the <mark>transformative power of engineering</mark>* <mark>and the incredible accomplishments achieved through creativity</mark>. It became evident that engineering knowledge, coupled with the ability to effectively communicate complex ideas, had the potential to bridge the gap between the technical and non-technical domains.

Driven by this realization, I embraced the world of article writing, <mark>seeking to share my engineering insights, experiences, and discoveries with a broader audience.</mark> I recognized that writing articles could not only educate and inspire fellow engineers but also empower individuals from diverse backgrounds to appreciate the wonders of engineering and its impact on our daily lives.

My transition from an engineer to an article writer has been an enriching and transformative journey. I have come to understand that <mark>article writing is not just a means of conveying information, but a powerful tool for storytelling, capturing the essence of engineering projects, and showcasing the brilliance behind their conception.</mark> It allows me to communicate the intricate details, the engineering marvels, and the human stories that often remain hidden behind technical jargon and diagrams.

> `" Share your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immortality. "`
> 
> *\- Dalai Lama*

By combining my technical expertise with the power of words, I strive to bridge the gap between the engineering community and the general public, fostering a deeper understanding and fostering collaboration for a better future.

### What am expecting from you...

*So, join me as I embark on this exciting journey of combining my engineering background with the art of article writing on tech things. Together, we will explore the endless possibilities of engineering and inspire a new generation of thinkers and innovators.*

*Welcome to my world of engineering and article writing‚Äîwhere the power of knowledge meets the elegance of expression.*

*Follow me:* [*https://harshabayyaram.bio.link/*](https://harshabayyaram.bio.link/)
